# Supporting Documents and Data Repository

Welcome to the repository of all supporting documents and data used and referenced in my personal blog, [kangifaz.com](https://kangifaz.com). This repository is designed to organize and share the resources that complement the articles published on my blog. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific blog post, reflecting its title, and contains the associated files, datasets, and documents discussed in that post.

## Purpose of This Repository

As a Master's student in Finance with a strong background in IT infrastructure, I am passionate about combining my technical expertise with finance research. Through my blog, I aim to share insights, methodologies, and analyses on topics such as:

- Financial data analysis
- IT and infrastructure integration in finance research
- Data-driven decision-making
- Research methodologies and case studies

This repository serves as an open resource for readers, collaborators, and fellow researchers who are interested in the details behind the articles published on my blog. By providing access to the original data and supporting documents, I strive to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research.

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is designed to mirror the blog's content. Each folder is named after the title of the corresponding blog post, ensuring that readers can easily locate resources related to a specific topic. Within each folder, you may find:

- **Datasets**: Raw or processed data used in analyses.
- **Documentation**: Detailed descriptions of the methodologies, tools, or frameworks applied.
- **Scripts**: Source code or algorithms implemented during research.
- **References**: Supporting materials, such as articles, reports, or papers referenced in the blog post.
